# godot-wiimote

A Wii Remote interface for Godot4 using GDExtension.

This is based on the [godot-cpp template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template), a quickstart template for GDExtension development with Godot 4.0+.

This project targets the latest verison of godot (4.1).

This repository was primarily created to perform wii remote head tracking using IR data from a static wii remote. While supporting additional functions of the wiimote are preferred, I am not familiar enough with godot to know what the best way to do this is - contributions are absolutely welcome!

## Contents
* An Godot project for demonstrating the functionality (`demo/`)
* godot-cpp as a submodule (`godot-cpp/`) to integrate with the WiiUse C++ library
* GitHub CI/CD confirm build functionality and upload library packages when creating a release (`.github/workflows/builds.yml`)
* source code for C++ GDExtension (`src/`)


## Dependencies 
In order to build, you must ensure dependencies are installed/available on your system.

### Wiiuse
Ensure the [WiiUse](https://github.com/wiiuse/wiiuse) library is installed in a location that can be found by your system

Wiiuse may also depend on additional things based on your platform, see the wiiuse README for more detailed, platform-specific instructions.

#### Building wiiuse (unix)
```
git clone https://github.com/wiiuse/wiiuse.git
cd wiiuse
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_EXAMPLE_SDL=NO -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE
make wiiuse
sudo make install
```

## Building
The build process should be realtively straghtforward since this project adheres to the typical GDExtension convention of using `scons` as a build system. For most platforms, the build process should just involve running the `scons` command.
